# 🚀 CI/CD Setup Guide for Financial Simulator

This guide explains how to set up and use the comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for the Financial Simulator project.

## 📋 Overview

The CI/CD pipeline provides:
- ✅ **Automated testing** on every push and PR
- ✅ **Syntax validation** to catch errors like the IndentationError we fixed
- ✅ **Code quality checks** with linting and formatting
- ✅ **Security scanning** for vulnerabilities
- ✅ **Docker containerization** testing
- ✅ **Automated deployment** to Render on successful builds

## 🏗️ Pipeline Architecture

### 3 Main Workflows

1. **`ci-cd.yml`** - Main CI/CD pipeline (runs on push to main/develop)
2. **`pr-validation.yml`** - Fast PR validation (runs on pull requests)
3. **`deploy-render.yml`** - Deployment workflow (manual or automatic)

### 6 Pipeline Stages

```
🔍 Code Quality & Syntax → 🧪 Unit Tests → 🔗 Integration Tests → 🔒 Security Scan → 🐳 Docker Build → 🚀 Deploy
```

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 1. Repository Setup

The pipeline files are already created in your repository:

```
.github/workflows/
├── ci-cd.yml           # Main CI/CD pipeline
├── pr-validation.yml   # PR validation
└── deploy-render.yml   # Deployment workflow

Backend/Financial_simulator/tests/
├── test_syntax_validation.py    # Catches IndentationError
├── test_financial_simulator.py  # Unit tests
└── integration/
    └── test_api_integration.py  # Integration tests
```

### 2. GitHub Secrets Configuration

Add these secrets in your GitHub repository settings (`Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions`):

#### Required for Deployment
```
RENDER_API_KEY          # Your Render API key
RENDER_SERVICE_ID       # Your Render service ID
RENDER_SERVICE_URL      # Your service URL (optional)
```

#### Required for Testing
```
OPENAI_API_KEY          # For integration tests
GROQ_API_KEY           # For integration tests
```

#### How to Get Render Credentials

1. **Render API Key**:
   - Go to [Render Dashboard](https://dashboard.render.com)
   - Click your profile → Account Settings
   - Go to API Keys → Create API Key
   - Copy the key

2. **Render Service ID**:
   - Go to your service in Render Dashboard
   - Copy the service ID from the URL: `https://dashboard.render.com/web/srv-XXXXXXXXX`
   - The service ID is the part after `srv-`

### 3. Enable GitHub Actions

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. Click `Actions` tab
3. If prompted, click `I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them`

## 🧪 Testing the Pipeline

### Method 1: Create a Pull Request

1. Create a new branch:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b test/pipeline-demo
   ```

2. Make a small change and push:
   ```bash
   echo "# Test change" >> README.md
   git add README.md
   git commit -m "test: Trigger pipeline demo"
   git push origin test/pipeline-demo
   ```

3. Create a Pull Request on GitHub
4. Watch the `PR Validation` workflow run

### Method 2: Use the Demo Script

Run the provided demo script (on Linux/Mac):
```bash
./create_demo_branch.sh
```

Or manually create the demo scenario:
1. Create branch: `git checkout -b demo/cicd-fix`
2. Add all CI/CD files: `git add .github/ Backend/Financial_simulator/tests/`
3. Commit: `git commit -m "Add CI/CD pipeline"`
4. Push: `git push origin demo/cicd-fix`

## 📊 Pipeline Stages Explained

### Stage 1: Code Quality & Syntax Check 🔍
**Purpose**: Catch syntax errors early (like our IndentationError)

**What it does**:
- Compiles all Python files
- Runs flake8 linting
- Checks code formatting with black
- Validates import sorting

**Key test**: The IndentationError in `langgraph_implementation.py` line 982 would be caught here.

### Stage 2: Unit Tests 🧪
**Purpose**: Test core functionality

**What it does**:
- Runs pytest on unit tests
- Tests module imports
- Validates function structures
- Generates code coverage reports

**Files tested**:
- `test_syntax_validation.py` - Catches the specific IndentationError
- `test_financial_simulator.py` - Tests core functionality

### Stage 3: Integration Tests 🔗
**Purpose**: Test API endpoints and database connections

**What it does**:
- Starts MongoDB and Redis services
- Tests API endpoints
- Validates database connections
- Tests end-to-end workflows

**Requirements**: MongoDB and Redis services (provided by GitHub Actions)

### Stage 4: Security Scan 🔒
**Purpose**: Check for security vulnerabilities

**What it does**:
- Runs Bandit security scanner
- Checks for known vulnerabilities with Safety
- Scans for common security issues

### Stage 5: Docker Build & Test 🐳
**Purpose**: Ensure containerization works

**What it does**:
- Builds Docker image
- Tests that the image runs correctly
- Validates container startup

### Stage 6: Deploy to Render 🚀
**Purpose**: Automated deployment

**What it does**:
- Triggers deployment to Render
- Waits for deployment completion
- Tests deployed service
- Notifies on success/failure

**Trigger**: Only runs on `main` branch with all tests passing

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### 1. Syntax Check Fails
```
❌ IndentationError: unexpected indent
```
**Solution**: Check indentation in Python files, ensure consistent spacing

#### 2. Tests Fail to Import Modules
```
❌ ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'langgraph_implementation'
```
**Solution**: Check PYTHONPATH configuration and file structure

#### 3. Integration Tests Timeout
```
❌ Connection timeout to MongoDB/Redis
```
**Solution**: Services are starting up, increase timeout or check service health

#### 4. Deployment Fails
```
❌ Render API authentication failed
```
**Solution**: Check that `RENDER_API_KEY` and `RENDER_SERVICE_ID` are set correctly

### Debug Steps

1. **Check GitHub Actions logs**:
   - Go to Actions tab in your repository
   - Click on the failed workflow
   - Expand the failed step to see detailed logs

2. **Run tests locally**:
   ```bash
   cd Backend/Financial_simulator
   python -m pytest tests/ -v
   ```

3. **Check syntax locally**:
   ```bash
   python -m py_compile Backend/Financial_simulator/Financial_simulator/langgraph_implementation.py
   ```

## 📈 Pipeline Benefits

### Before CI/CD Pipeline
- ❌ Manual testing required
- ❌ Syntax errors discovered late
- ❌ Inconsistent deployment process
- ❌ No automated quality checks

### After CI/CD Pipeline
- ✅ Automated testing on every change
- ✅ Syntax errors caught in < 2 minutes
- ✅ Consistent, reliable deployments
- ✅ Comprehensive quality validation
- ✅ Clear feedback on issues

## 🎯 Best Practices

### For Developers

1. **Create feature branches** for all changes
2. **Create Pull Requests** to trigger validation
3. **Fix issues** highlighted by the pipeline
4. **Don't merge** until all checks pass

### For Maintainers

1. **Require status checks** before merging
2. **Review pipeline results** in PRs
3. **Keep secrets updated** in repository settings
4. **Monitor deployment** success rates
